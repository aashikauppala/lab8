Introduction of Summary: The goal of this lab was to design and implement a mobile app capable of wirelessly controlling a robot car using Bluetooth communication. This project builds upon previous labs by integrating hardware components such as motors, sensors, and the SparkFun RedBoard with software tools including Arduino IDE and MIT App Inventor. By the end of the lab, the robot car should be able to move forward, backward, left, and right at varying speeds via commands sent from a smartphone.
To achieve this, we first assembled the robot car and tested basic motion through wired serial communication. We then used MIT App Inventor to create a simple Android app capable of sending directional commands to the car. In the final stage, we implemented Bluetooth functionality using the HC-05 module and modified both the Arduino sketch and the app to support wireless communication. 

Discussion: During testing, we discovered that the full assembly of the robot, including its battery pack, chassis, and motors with wheels, added weight and resistance compared to testing just the motors in Lab 6. As a result, the minimum PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) value required to move the complete robot was higher. After trial and error, we determined that a PWM value of approximately 50 was necessary to overcome the initial static friction and start the robot’s motion reliably. This value may vary slightly based on build and surface conditions but was a consistent threshold in our testing.

Conclusion: This lab successfully demonstrated the integration of hardware and software systems through the development of a Bluetooth-controlled robot car. By using MIT App Inventor and the HC-05 Bluetooth module, we learned how to create a custom Android application capable of wirelessly communicating with an Arduino-based robot. The process required modifying both the app and the Arduino sketch to handle Bluetooth commands, as well as troubleshooting issues related to hardware connections and communication protocols.
From this lab, we gained hands-on experience in mobile app development, serial communication, and embedded system design. Most importantly, we saw how accessible tools like App Inventor can be used to prototype real-world applications. This experience has deepened our understanding of system integration and highlighted the importance of testing, iterative design, and user interface considerations in engineering solutions.
